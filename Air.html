  <h3>Where it gets its name from</h3>
  <dd>The Architects of Air specialize in large pneumatic sculptures called "Luminaria" which are essentially domes and geometric shapes connected while being held up by the air that is being pumped in.</dd>
  <br>
  <dd>Walking into one of their Luminaria will make you appreciate the hard work that has been put into it while understanding exactly why they are called the Architects of Air.</dd>
  <br>
  <dd>The designs of the Luminaria are inspired by geometric solids, natural forms, Islamic and Gothic Architecture.</dd>

  <h3>Popularity</h3>
  <dd>Whenever a Luminaria pop's up, it becomes the talk of the town.</dd>
  <br>
  <dd>Their breathtaking designs welcome people of all ages.</dd>
<br>
  <dd>I had to wait in line for over 30 minutes to buy a ticket.</dd>
  <br>
  <dd>Since the inside is a maze, parents enjoy taking their kids to the Luminaria's to explore.</dd>

  <h3>Scenery</h3>
  <dd>Air isn't the only factor being played with however, the Luminaria's top is made from a fabric that lets light pass through it, allowing the inside to shine brightly with the colors of the fabric.</dd>
  <br>
  <dd>The Architects of Air design their Luminaria as mazes, allowing you to explore and even get lost in their creation.</dd>
<br>
  <dd>It's recommended to explore the Luminaria at around Noon for the best experience, however, the experience is never the same every time.</dd>
  <br>
  <dd>The atmosphere inside the Luminaria changes due to the weather and light outside, making every visit unique.</dd>

  <h3>The experience</h3>
  <dd>Before entering the Luminaria you're asked to remove your shoes and are given a map of the structure, for every structure is designed differently.</dd>
  <br>
  <dd>Upon entering, you're hit by different colors of light that create an ambiance like no other.</dd>
<br>
  <dd>The shapes of each section play a big part in how light bounces off of the fabric on the wall and into the visitor's eyes, making them overwhelmed by the different colors and shapes they're seeing.</dd>
  <br>
  <dd>The Architects of Air emphasize the designs they use based on Islamic and Gothic architecture, bringing out the beauty of each type of architecture.</dd>
