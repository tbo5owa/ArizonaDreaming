  <h3>Where it gets its name from</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt></dt>
  <dd>Wonder Spaces is an art exhibit that changes year-round, playing with visual illusions and art structures.
  <br><br>
  Every area of the exhibit has a different theme to it, while one area is dark and filled with small lights, the other is a lit room with art pieces on the wall.
  <br><br>
  Since the art in the exhibit changes frequently, you're left to wonder what you'll find next time.

  <h3>Popularity</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt></dt>
  <dd>Wonder Spaces is mostly popular amongst teens and young adults since the fresh artwork are perfect for picture taking.
  <br><br>
  A lot of their visitors are students of Arizona State University. However, highschool students from around Tempe and Scottsdale also visit the art exhibit frequently.
<br><br>
  Tickets could be bought online or upon entry, although getting the tickets online would be best for a faster entry.

  <h3>Scenery</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt></dt>
  <dd>The art exhibit features art pieces from multiple artists.
  <br><br>
  Every room offers a different perspective from the artist's point of view, some being visual illusions while others are large structures.
<br><br>
  It's interesting to see how an artist visualizes art and can share that vision with others.
  <br><br>
  From flashing lights to mind-bending sculptures, Wonder Spaces offers a change of scenery to all its visitors.

  <h3>The experience</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt></dt>
  <dd>With a lot of rooms to visit, it's easy to lose track of time while looking at art.
  <br><br>
  The first room I visited had a box that you enter into, the walls inside were black and the floor was a mirror, with projectors on top shining visually pleasing light patterns that lit up the whole room.
  <br><br>
  The second room had string lights hung from the ceiling flashing with patterns that were very interesting to look at.
  <br><br>
Every part of the exhibit left you with a yearning for more, with the last room being an art piece that visitors create by leaving written notes on the wall.
